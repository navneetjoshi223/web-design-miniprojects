Hello!

For this assignment, I have created a car rental website in which a user can see the variety of cars available for renting.

The website consists of 3 pages: 
1. The homepage which gives a glimpse of what all the business has to offer.
2. A page which showcases a list of cars available for renting out.
3. Contact us page where the customers can add their details and contact "NJ luxury car rentals"
